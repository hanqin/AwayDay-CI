This feature examines XML output produced by the
<a href="http://tools.android.com/tips/lint">Android Lint</a> tool and
presents the results on the build page for analysis.
<p>
Note that this does not run Lint for you &mdash; Lint results in XML format
must be generated and available in the build workspace for analysis to occur.
</p>
<p>
For best results, run Lint in your Android application's directory, e.g.:
<tt>cd my-app; lint --xml lint-results.xml .</tt><br>
Otherwise you should add the <tt>--fullpath</tt> switch when running lint.
</p>
<p>
Lint from Android SDK Tools r17 or newer should be used. Output from r16 is
supported, but will only display limited results.
