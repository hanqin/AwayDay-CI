Adding custom hardware properties allows you to override the default values for an AVD.<br/>
For example, you can alter the amount of RAM available to each process (via the <tt>vm.heapSize</tt>
property), or you can alter physical features of the emulated device, such as the presence of a keyboard.
<p>
A list of common properties, along with their descriptions and default values can be found in the
&quot;<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/avd.html#hardwareopts">Setting
hardware emulator options</a>&quot; section of the Android Developers' site.
</p>
<p>
To set a new hardware feature (or override a default value), enter the property name and the desired value.<br/>
Generally, boolean properties should be either <tt>yes</tt> or <tt>no</tt> rather than true or false.
</p>
<p>
Hardware properties configured here will be added to the appropriate AVD next time this job runs.<br/>
However, removing hardware properties from the job configuration will not remove these properties from the AVD
&mdash; the previously-added properties will remain.
